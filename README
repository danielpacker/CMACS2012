ScanBatch is a program for running large batches of simulations
using BioNetGen (http://bionetgen.org).

See the example config file 'scan.conf' for an example of how to
set up a batch run.

The program logic is in lib/ScanBatch.pm and the command line 
program is sb.pl.

=== INSTALLATION ===

To install, download ScanBatch from github at:
https://github.com/danielpacker/CMACS2012/

You can do a git clone, or download the files directly.

=== RUNNING ===

perl sb.pl [config-file-path]

[config-file-path] is optional. By default sb.pl looks for a config file called sb.conf in your working directory.

There are several important environment variables you can set to change where files are sought or saved:

SB_MODEL_DIR='path-to-model-files'
SB_DATA_DIR='path-to-where-data-is-saved' 
BNGPATH='path-to-bionetgen-dir'

Here's an example of setting all of these and running sb.pl in one line:
SB_MODEL_DIR='models' SB_DATA_DIR='/tmp/sb_data' BNGPATH='../rulebender/BioNetGen-2.1.7/' perl sb.pl

This command uses /tmp for the data files, ./models for the model files, and the BNG that comes with my copy of rulebender.

=== CONFIG FILE ===

See sb.conf that comes with your installation for info.

=== DATA FILES ===

ScanBatch saves files in the directory you specify via SB_DATA_DIR or in ./sb_data by default. The data is organized like this:

sb_data/
	scanbatch.log
	model_name/
		species_name1/
			species_name_0001.gdat
			species_name_0002.gdat
			...
		species_name2/
			species_name_2_0001.gdat
			species_name_2_0002.gdat
			...

The log file contains the output of BNG2.pl (bionetgen).

In addition to all of the gdat files (and cdat files), other files may be created, as specified in your model file.
