ScanBatch is a program for running large batches of simulations using 
BioNetGen (http://bionetgen.org). 

It is loosely based (in particular, the method of generating modified BNGL 
files) on the scan_var.pl program that comes with BNG, but promises to be 
a great deal more helpful for automated data generation. It currently 
supports ranges of concentrations across arbitrary numbers of models, 
species, concentrations, and runs per concentration.

See the example config file 'sb.conf' for an example of how to set up a 
batch run.

The program logic is in lib/ScanBatch.pm and the command line program is sb.pl.

=== INSTALLATION ===

To install, download ScanBatch from github at:
https://github.com/danielpacker/CMACS2012/

You can do a git clone, or download the files directly.

=== RUNNING ===

perl sb.pl [config-file-path]

[config-file-path] is optional. By default sb.pl looks for a config file 
called sb.conf in your working directory.

There are several important environment variables you can set to change where 
files are sought or saved:

SB_MODEL_DIR='path-to-model-files'
SB_DATA_DIR='path-to-where-data-is-saved' 
BNGPATH='path-to-bionetgen-dir'

Here's an example of setting all of these and running sb.pl in one line:
SB_MODEL_DIR='models' SB_DATA_DIR='/tmp/sb_data' BNGPATH='../rulebender/BioNetGen-2.1.7/' perl sb.pl

This command uses /tmp for the data files, ./models for the model files, and 
the BNG that comes with my copy of rulebender.

=== CONFIG FILE ===

See sb.conf that comes with your installation for info.

=== DATA FILES ===

ScanBatch saves files in the directory you specify via SB_DATA_DIR or 
in ./sb_data by default. The data is organized like this:

sb_data/
	scanbatch.log
	model_name/
		species_name1/
			[CONCENTRATION]/
				00001.gdat
				00002.gdat
				...
			[CONCENTRATION]/
				00001.gdat
				00002.gdat
				...
		species_name2/
		...
	model_name2/
	...

There are as many models, species, concentrations, and runs as specified 
in the config file. The log file contains the output of BNG2.pl (bionetgen). 
[CONCENTRATION] refers to a directory with a numerical name.

A typical data file path might look like this:
/tmp/sb_data/toy-jim/L(r)/3.33333333333333/00064.gdat

This file is in a data directory of '/tmp/sb_data', for a model 'toy-jim.bngl', 
setting the concentration of species L(r) to 3.33333333333333 on the 64th run.

In addition to all of the gdat files (and cdat files), other files may be 
created, as specified in your model file.

=== TODO ===

* Allow config to specify if a given entry is for a paramters or a 
  concentration corresponding to setParamter() or setConcentration()
* Allow config to specify a range from start_val to end_val or
  to specify a series (perhaps start_val can be a list?)
* Add generation of time-series data by skimming the generated gdat
  files for a given target (column) and threshhold value specified
  in the model config. Perhaps:
  [model.bngl]
  threshhold=123
  target_column=2
* Remove double quotes around 2nd arg for setConcenration()
* Don't overwrite network?
* Save equil run data in appropriate subdirs (currently hard coded to 'equil')
